### Semantic Search using Text Embeddings


The document search engine incorporates a new search feature that utilizes text embeddings from OpenAI's large language model, 
providing more accurate and relevant search results. Here's an explanation of what this means and how it differs from traditional search methods.

##### What are text embeddings?

Text embeddings can be thought of as a way to convert complex language into a simpler, mathematical representation that computers 
can understand more easily. By representing words, phrases, and paragraphs as points in a high-dimensional space, text embeddings 
enable our search engine to process and interpret the meaning of the text more effectively.

##### How is this search different from traditional text matching search?

Traditional search engines often rely on matching keywords or phrases from your search query to those found in documents. While this 
method has its merits, it can sometimes miss the true meaning or context behind the words being used.

This new search feature, powered by text embeddings from OpenAI's large language model, takes a more sophisticated approach. By converting 
both your search query and the documents into embeddings, we can measure the similarity between them in the high-dimensional space. 
This allows our search engine to better understand the meaning and context of the words, phrases, and sentences, providing more relevant 
and accurate results that better align with your intentions.

##### How should you construct your query?

Be clear and specific when crafting your query. There's no need to worry about whether the words or phrases will exactly match the text 
you want to find. The search engine will focus on understanding the meaning behind your query and deliver relevant results accordingly.

You can use English, French, Spanish, Arabic, German and other languages.         

### Question and Answer with ChatGPT and TPR reports

This is a Q&A tool that combines the capabilities of ChatGPT and TPR reports to answer questions about WTO members' trade policy. The tool leverages 
TPR reports as a source of information and utilizes ChatGPT as an assistant to gather information and generate answers in natural language. To assess 
the quality of the answers, the tool presents both the responses obtained solely from ChatGPT and those that incorporate TPR data.

One known challenge when using ChatGPT for factual question-answering is its occasional tendency to invent or imagine information. Although Large 
anguage Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT possess a vast range of general knowledge, this breadth does not always guarantee precise accuracy. To mitigate 
this issue, the tool incorporates TPR reports as an "external knowledge base," enabling us to provide more reliable and specific responses.

### TPR dataset

The dataset consists of 204 Trade Policy Review Secretariat reports issued since 2010, including a total 100,390 paragraphs.

Each record in the dataset represents a paragraph from the TPR reports. Paragraphs are identified by the member, document symbol, and topic (section-subsection).

The topics listed below roughly correspond to the sections and subsections found in the Secretariat reports:


| Topic - level 1                  | Topic - level 2                      | Topic - level 3                          |
